## Durable notes
- User confirmed assistant identity: **frankie-bot**, creature **AI**, vibe **warm**, emoji **:)**.
- User name captured as **Frank Shi**; preferred form of address: **Frank**.
- Identity/profile files were updated and committed in workspace git history.
- User asked for a summary of junior high school math curriculum (provided structured CN summary).
- User asked for Yahoo Finance Google price check; assistant retrieved GOOG/GOOGL values from Yahoo.
- User requested sending email to `wenjun81@gmail.com`; direct send failed because current channel/tooling is Telegram-only (no configured email route). This limitation was communicated multiple times.
- User uploaded a Barclays PDF report (`Energy Commodities: Chart Book: Talkin' Hawkin'`, 2026-02-09, 20 pages) and requested analysis; assistant summarized key points (geopolitics, US supply, India demand, inventories, flows, gas/weather).
- Email workflow preference update: user uses **himalaya v1.0+** and wants email actions done via `himalaya envelope list` (read/list) and `himalaya message send` (send).
- Remembered sender preference: use `From: wenjun81@gmail.com` when sending outbound emails for the user.
- User requested quant automation focus on **XLE (能源)** and **SOXX (半导体)**: daily close brief at **08:00 Asia/Shanghai**, recipient `shi.wenjun@twinkle-trade.com`, and **GSR < 40** alert with dual channel (email + Telegram).
- Implemented automation scripts in `myrepo` and created cron jobs: daily brief job `7be512e0-2720-4cc8-abab-d6fc01430bfc`, GSR job `3735dbc8-92f9-420c-8de7-1a2e351717c8`.
- Himalaya send path is unstable in this environment: repeated timeout `EXIT:124`, occasional panic (`mail-parser ... index out of bounds`), and IMAP save failure (`Folder doesn't exist`) indicating Sent-folder mapping/config issues.
- User requested math solution images without code; first generated image had missing-glyph boxes (font compatibility issue), user asked for redo.
