## Durable notes
- User preference update: no longer send emails for automated reports/alerts; Telegram-only delivery preferred.
- Added ETF universe for daily brief: XLE, SOXX, QQQ, SPY, GLD, SLV, VWO.
- News broadcast format updated to include one-line summary and prefer facts+data; if source restricted, fallback to RSS with explicit timestamp and real-time/history label.
- Built `gog` from source (`/tmp/gogcli/bin/gog`) after installing Go 1.25; started Google OAuth manual flow to upload report to Google Doc.
- Completed Google OAuth for `gog` account `wenjun81@gmail.com` (services: drive,docs); uploaded report file to Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fn6WwwsDXgbPc6coyfO51X1y3EcP6-cG/view?usp=drivesdk
- Automation status now: three active cron jobs — hourly 4-media news digest, 30-minute GSR alert check (<40), and daily 08:00 Asia/Shanghai ETF brief (XLE/SOXX/QQQ/SPY/GLD/SLV/VWO), all Telegram-only.
