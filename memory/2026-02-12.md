## Durable notes
- User preference update: no longer send emails for automated reports/alerts; Telegram-only delivery preferred.
- Added ETF universe for daily brief: XLE, SOXX, QQQ, SPY, GLD, SLV, VWO.
- News broadcast format updated to include one-line summary and prefer facts+data; if source restricted, fallback to RSS with explicit timestamp and real-time/history label.
- Built `gog` from source (`/tmp/gogcli/bin/gog`) after installing Go 1.25; started Google OAuth manual flow to upload report to Google Doc.
- Current pending state: waiting for user to return OAuth redirect URL for state `33ulCtgprPc69MGlQhL_8eIZqWhzTaZCJuT8XnlYpm4` to complete Drive/Docs authorization.
