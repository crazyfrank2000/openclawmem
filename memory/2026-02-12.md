# 2026-02-12

## Durable notes
- User preference update: no longer send emails for automated reports/alerts; Telegram-only delivery preferred.
- Added ETF universe for daily brief: XLE, SOXX, QQQ, SPY, GLD, SLV, VWO.
- News broadcast format updated to include one-line summary and prefer facts+data; if source restricted, fallback to RSS with explicit timestamp and real-time/history label.
- Built `gog` from source (`/tmp/gogcli/bin/gog`) after installing Go 1.25; started Google OAuth manual flow to upload report to Google Doc.
- Completed Google OAuth for `gog` account `wenjun81@gmail.com` (services: drive,docs); uploaded report file to Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fn6WwwsDXgbPc6coyfO51X1y3EcP6-cG/view?usp=drivesdk
- Automation status now: three active cron jobs — hourly 4-media top5 digest, every-2-hours todo dialog check-in, and daily 08:00 Asia/Shanghai ETF brief (XLE/SOXX/QQQ/SPY/GLD/SLV/VWO), all Telegram-only.
- User requested planning support: read one paper with AI analysis (P1), make study plan for 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-22 (calculus/linear algebra/statistics), write daily market insights into Google Doc, and bind daily work with Google Calendar.
- Google OAuth for gog succeeded for account `wenjun81@gmail.com` (docs/drive); report uploaded to Drive at `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fn6WwwsDXgbPc6coyfO51X1y3EcP6-cG/view?usp=drivesdk`.
- Current blocker: gog binary path lost after /tmp cleanup; need to restore/locate executable before querying Google Calendar week schedule.
